      "{'source': 'race', 'story': 'Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from online retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues , which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage. \\n\\n\"Their overhead is lower, but they don\\'t offer a service like we do,\" Pollock said. \\n\\nPollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales. \\n\\n\"We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it on line,\" he said. \\n\\nAccording to the state comptroller\\'s office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses. \\n\\nIn spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. \"You have a larger selection and it\\'s easier to compare prices.\" \\n\\nWilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping on line. \\n\\n\"Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,\" he said. \"Before I started shopping on line I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping on line saved me from having to buy from Dell.\" \\n\\nJanny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal. \\n\\n\"\\'d rather see it in person, touch it, know that I\\'m getting it,\" she said. \\n\\nBrazeal also said she would not give out her credit card number or other personal information on line no matter how safe the site claims it is.', 'questions': ['What is a valuable service?', 'What is the issue?', 'When did it begin?', 'Is is happening quickly?', 'What is a safety issue?', 'What is easier about online?', 'Overhead higher or lower?', 'What is a reason online is cheaper?', 'why?', 'who does it affect most?'], 'answers': {'input_text': ['brick and mortar stores', 'competition from online retailers', 'with mail-order catalogues', 'yes', 'online security', 'variety and accessibility', 'lower', 'overhead is lower', 'few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage', 'local businessmen'], 'answer_start': [101, 42, 240, 765, 1653, 964, 429, 416, 325, 0], 'answer_end': [113, 76, 266, 826, 1783, 989, 434, 434, 408, 17]}}\n",

The university, established in 1890, consists of The College, various graduate programs, interdisciplinary committees organized into four academic research divisions and seven professional schools.

The university currently enrolls approximately 5,000 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall. \\n\\nUniversity of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics, the Chicago school of sociology, the law and economics movement in legal analysis, the Chicago school of literary criticism, the Chicago school of religion, and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world-renowned institutions like the nearby Fermilab and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory.
